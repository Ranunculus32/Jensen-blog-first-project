          When I become a mom of two, I become wiser with my purchases. Below
          are the six must have baby items to make your second motherhood more
          efficient and almost effortless.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          1. <a href="#"> Najell Babynest.</a> This is the most useful baby item
          for me and my husband in the first 4 months of life of our second
          child. In fact, in those months she barely slept in her baby crib.
          This product makes our life so much easier. She sleep in it in the
          morning, and since it can be open up to be a playmat, she stays on it
          most of the day. When we have to use the stroller, we just lift the
          babynest to the stroller and we are ready to go. And when she falls
          asleep, moving her around while in it, is not disturbing her at all.
          Even at night, she slept inside the nest which is easy for me and my
          husband to do the baby duty as we just lift her around in it. The best
          buy we ever made!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.
          <a href="#"> Medela double breast pump and medela pumping bra.</a
          >These two has to come together. The pumping makes busy mom conserve
          more time by being efficient. I usually pump for 10min every 5 hours.
          And this is just so easy to use and so nipple friendly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          3.
          <a href="#"> Ikea led lamp : Kornsnö and Spiken.</a>
          These are the cheapest and most practical lamps I used mainly for
          nightly baby duties. Spiken led lamp allows different colors, and I
          mainly used the red and the yellow light. Red is mainly on for the
          whole night so I can see things around while not disturbing our sleep.
          And the yellow is when I change nappies. The Kornsnö is for when I
          need a stronger light in just one tap. Easy to turn on and off and it
          turns off on its own after about 10min.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          4. Organizer bag. Any bag will do. This is where you put all baby
          essentials: diapers, wet wipes, nipple cream, baby poweder, creams,
          pacifiers etc. Find a lightweight organizer that you can easily carry
          around the house when you look after your baby. Trust me, life is a
          lot easier with baby essentials in a carry on organizer bag than in a
          box stayed in one place.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          5. Baby pajamas. Baby pajamas may not look so cute compare to smart
          suit or beautiful dresses that many new parents prefer to dress up
          their babies, but mind you these are the most practical. You will
          realized that a newborn sleeps a lot and feed and poop a lot. So, a
          normal day would be 10 soiled diapers and two new clothes. Pajamas, is
          the easiest for nappy changing and comfort of the child.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="#">5. Satin mommy pajamas. </a> You have to remember that the
          first 6 weeks postpartum is crucial for recovery. Some new mothers
          will experience night sweating, chills and shivers, milk leaking and
          constant blood vaginal discharge as well. Having a comfortable and
          warm satin pajamas really is god send. Easy to put on and off, warm
          and soft and is just made to make you comfortable with your new body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know there are still more useful items out there, but as a second
          time mother, these 5 above are the most useful, practical and cost
          efficient products that makes life so much easier specially made for
          multitasking parents.
